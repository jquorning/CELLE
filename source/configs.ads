   --  A configuration is a production rule of the grammar together with
   --  a mark (dot) showing how much of that rule has been processed so far.
   --  Configurations also contain a follow-set which is a list of terminal
   --  symbols which are allowed to immediately follow the end of the rule.
   --  Every configuration is recorded as an instance of the following:

   type Config_Status is (Complete, Incomplete);

   type Config_Record;
   type Config_Access is access all Config_Record;

   type Config_Record is
      record

         Rule : Rule_Lists.Rule_Access;
         --  The rule upon which the configuration is based

         Dot : Rules.Dot_Type;
         --  The parse point

         Follow_Set : Symbol_Sets.Set_Type;
         --  Follow-set for this configuration only

         Forward_PL : Prop_Links.List;
         --  Forward propagation links

         Backward_PL : Prop_Links.List;
         --  Follow-set backwards propagation links

         State : access States.State_Record;
         --  Pointer to state which contains this

         Status : Config_Status;
         --  Used during followset and shift computations

         Next : Config_Access;
         --  Next configuration in the state

         Basis : Config_Access;
         --  The next basis configuration
